# Data Scientist nano degree

# Description 
Udacity's project titled as "Image Classifier with deep learning" aim to train a network to recognize different specices of flowers. please note that the data is not avaliable as of it's large size.

As of the next few years software developers  need to know how to incorporate deep learning models withing their application anything that uses camera could be running image classificatin, object detection and much more.
so the goal of the project is to implement an image classification application it will train on a large set of images -which require gpu otherwise it will consume much of your time-
which then will use the trained model to classify new images.
Jupyter notebook is is walkthrough of the implementation of the deep learning model, to make sure implementation  works.
as final part of the project is convert the notebook to a python application that runs from command line.
